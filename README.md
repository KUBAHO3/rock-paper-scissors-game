## Explanation of rock-paper-scissors game
- What is a rock-paper-scissors game?
A rock-paper-scissors is a game in which the winner is determined by the compatibility of three
different hand signs.

-- The ① hand shape represents a stone.
  
-- The ② hand shape represents a paper.

-- The ③ hand shape represents a scissors.

Stone wins over scissors because stone is hard and cannot
be cut with scissors.

Scissors win over paper because scissors can cut paper.
Paper wins over stone because paper can wrap stone.
When both players play the same hand shape, the game is a
draw. Then the game is repeated until there is a winner.
The rock-paper-scissors game can be played by any number of players, but this time we will assume
two players. The players are you and the computer.
